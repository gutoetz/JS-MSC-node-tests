# Product Management Backend

This project is a Product Management Backend application that allows for the registration, deletion, and updating of products, as well as the registration of sales. The backend is developed in JavaScript, following the MSC (Model, Service, Controller) architecture pattern, and utilizes Node.js, Express, Docker, and MySQL for the database.

## Overview

The Product Management Backend application serves as the server-side component for managing product data and sales records. It provides APIs for creating, deleting, and updating products, as well as recording sales transactions. The project adopts the MSC (Model, Service, Controller) architecture pattern to organize and structure the codebase efficiently.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and frameworks were utilized in the development of this project:

- JavaScript: JavaScript is the programming language used to develop the backend logic of the application.
- MSC Architecture: The MSC (Model, Service, Controller) architecture pattern separates the application logic into distinct layers, enhancing code organization and maintainability.
- Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side.
- Express: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building APIs.
- Docker: Docker is used for containerization, enabling the creation of isolated environments and simplified deployment.
- MySQL: MySQL is a widely used relational database management system that provides efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval.

## Functionality

The Product Management Backend application offers the following features and functionality:

- Product Management: It provides APIs for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting product records.
- Sales Registration: The application allows the registration of sales transactions, including relevant details such as product, quantity, and price.
- Database Interaction: It interacts with the MySQL database to store and retrieve product and sales data.
- API Endpoints: The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints for seamless integration with frontend or client applications.
